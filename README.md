Data Analysis project using hotel data to find trends

Data Analysis Project Pipeline:
1. Building a database
2. Developing the SQL queries
3. Connecting Power BI to the Database
4. Visualization
5. Summarizing of findings

Final interactive dashboard to visualize trends in hotel industry. Dashboard shows trends of revenue, average of ADR (average daily rate), average of discount, required car parking spaces throughout a specific timeline (2018-2020).

Project answered three questions:
1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year? - General trend is increasing but in 2020 we noticed quite a drop due to pandemic. However, revenue was 3 times bigger than in 2018.
2. Should we increase car parking space in those hotels? - We can see that only 2,05% up to 2,67% of the bookings required space at that time and the trend is constant.
3. What trends can we see in data? - Increasing trend in revenue, total nights, discount and ADR. Due to pandemic we noticed decreasing trend yet numbers were higher than in 2018.
